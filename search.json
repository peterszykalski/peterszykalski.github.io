    "text": "the phone did the job\nThe phenomenon of passing comet in the CET time zone in the southwestern part of my sky lasted for several Earth days. However, I wanted to record somehow characteristic tail for the comet. Stellarium app helped to locate the position of the C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan-ATLAS) comet. The challenge was to take a photo because, in my time zone, it was already a very dark night. With help came the cell phone.\nExposure time: 30 sec\nAperture Value: 1.68EV (f/1.8)\nFocal Length: 4.7 mm\nShutter Speed: 4.91 (1/30 sec)\nISO Speed Ratings: 403"

    "text": "the question WHY?\nAfter HR recruiters asked me why I have a half a year blank spot in my CV I decided to reveal the truth. On the first of October 2023, I started Physics studies faculty Photnics at the Warsaw University of Technology.\n\nMy dream was to follow Niels Bohr’s footsteps but really, the power of Photons convinced me. That is also the answer to the WHY question! But being more specific: IMHO the discovery world right now is on the quantum level size where Light with its dual nature plays a key role. The subtle difference between light emitted from a simple lightbulb and a Laser is as mindblowing as the Laser invention story. 50 years after Einstein predicted the creation of such an instrument finally Theodore Maiman did it in 1960. Yeah, that is the power of Applied Physics from theory to practice. It was just the beginning of the silent revolution, the next Big Thing after the transistor was discovered in 1942 by William Shockley with a team. Today it is even hard to imagine the World without the Lasers. Lasers are everywhere. Laser devices cut metal, are used in medicine and most important laser beams can transfer Information. An interesting example of laser usage is the femtosecond laser. Their beam is incredibly fast and powerful hence avoidance of thermal effect is possible, it is crucial when you influence with the beam on a substrate with the expectation of ultra-high precision and micro scale. The light has changed the telecommunications we know today and will be the main driver in this industry for the next fifty years, not only because of Fiber technology but of course because of lasers that right now are introduced in Outerspace communication for example gradually on new batches of Starlink satellites. Without the Optics, we won’t be able to speed up our next-generation processors, particularly AI processors. Some movements towards new technological breakthroughs happen in chip interconnections. An early explorer of this technology is Ayarlabs company showcasing 4 Tbps Optical FPGA Demo.\n\n\n\nMy univeristy dorm also known as Alcatraz.\n\n\nSo those are only a few reasons why I decided to study Photonics. Every kid on this lucky Planet called Earth knows that the Light it is a source of energy for every living plant or creature and is indispensable. Nevertheless, my plan to become the next photonic engineer has finished after half a year. Studies were possible only in full-day mode and I could not find a job that allowed me to share my scientific desire.\nOverall conclusions? It’s healthy to leave your comfort zone and try something else."

    "text": "GE team Chciago\n\n\n\nlandscape back then\nW istotny sposób zmienił się krajobraz technologiczny od czasu gdy powstało to pamiątkowe zdjęcie. Okoliczności to siedziba GE Transportation, 24 piętro wieżowca 500 W Monroe St, Chicago.\n\n\n\nGE skyscraper\n\n\nMoja firma jako polski podwykonawca wdrażała komponent IoT dla platformy o marketingowej nazwie Predix. Ten z kolei Predix był częścią większego projektu EdgeLINC™ autonomizującego sterowanie oraz odczyt stanu większości parametrów eksploatacyjnych Lokomowty Cargo. Był to rodzaj czarnej skrzynki ,która rejestrowała status lokomotywy oraz komunikowała się z Chmurą. Główny stack technologiczny stanowiła Java na edge’u oraz na cloud backendzie ulubione środowisko dużych corpo. Dziś trudno powiedzieć co pozostało z tego projektu produkcyjnie, ale niewątpliwie była to okazja, żeby live przekonać się o wadach i zaletach różnych decyzji architektonicznych w tak dużym projekcie. Kontenery? pozostały, wówczas to był jeszcze Docker_Swarm dziś powszechny jest Kubernetes. Kafka - message broker zdaje się, że nadal w wielu systemach dużych firm to dominujące rozwiązanie. Z punktu widzenia roli jaką wówczas pełniłem, Support Enginer’a to było cenne doświadczenie. Utrzymanie “operacyjne” cykli wydań od Zespołu Developerskiego w Katowicach po instalację i uruchomienie kolejnych wersji na środowisku u Klienta wraz wieloma komponentami 3th-party stanowiło wyzwanie.\n\n\nmigration to development\nObecnie po tych kilku latach od tego projektu oraz po kilku kolejnych równie intersujących projektach gównie z branży IIoT narast chęć bardziej kreatywnego wypływania na powierzone obowiązki - a więc “from Support to DEVelopment” idąc dalej “to Rust Development”. Dlaczego? Powodów jest wiele dlaczego warto przygodę z językiem Rust zacząć. Oto kilka z nich być może najbardziej spektakularnych:\n\nLinux introduces support for rust\nAWS announces general availability of the AWS SDK for Rust\nNSA memory save roadmap\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nProgramming languages such as C and C++ are examples of memory unsafe programming languages that can lead to memory unsafe code and are still among the most widely used languages today."

    "text": "Imagine\nLet’s suppose you are on a delegation equipped with your handy laptop but suddenly you need access to the data from recent project residing on your main desktop at your homeLAB. Moreover, the issue is the energy. You don’t want to warm up the atmosphere or waste energy in vain for a computer tha is in use just for few minutes. So what to do? First, you need to connect to your local or office (that is not the issue of this post) network then you need to trigger the switch button to turn on your computer. But the hell! How you can to that remotely? The answer is the “Wake-on-Lan” mechanism.\n\n\nWoL in short\nFor short Wake-on-LAN (WoL) is a feature in which a PHY network card in a very low power state can be awakened by a host using a uniquely formatted packet called a magic packet. This requires decoding a magic packet and alerting a board controller by asserting an interrupt pin when a packet match is detected - this will start your computer. How this happens? Install wakeonlan tool and then execute the command. This command sends famous “magic packet”.\nsudo wakeonlan [$mac_address of computer you want to wakeUP] Sending magic packet to 255.255.255.255:9 with [$mac_address]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIt is a wired network interface case. On a wifi network interface, WoL can be enabled too but slightly different.\n\n\n\n\nbut before\nThe basic requirement is to have the WoL functionality enabled in UEFI. This option needs to be enabled: PCIe Device Power On\nHaving that, WoL needs to be enabled in Linux kernel. Ethtool will be indispensable in order to verify this. Execute:\nsudo ethtool [your active network intefrace name] if in the output you see this line: Wake-on: g you are good if you see this: Wake-on: d execute the command: ethtool -s %i wol g where i% is the name of your active network interface. Now you are ready to wake up your computer remotely but only once. After you start your computer again the procedure needs to be repeated. Yeap, you need to automate this and do this persistent every time you turn on a computer.\n\n\nWoL persistent\ngo to: /etc/systemd/system use sudo and touch the file wol@.service and put into what follows:\n[Unit]\nDescription=Wake-on-LAN for %i\nRequires=network.target\nAfter=network.target network-online.target\n\n[Service]\nRestart=on-failure\nRestartSec=10s\nExecStart=/usr/bin/ethtool -s %i wol g\nType=simple\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\nNext enable the service: sudo systemctl enable wol@enp1s0.service where enp1s0 replace with your name for the network card\nNext start the service: sudo systemctl start wol@enp1s0.service\nAlmost done but after the reboot, service still not triggers Wake-on: g on your network interface? Here is the catch: TLP - subsytem optimizing Linux laptop battery life. Sounds funny because I’m not on a laptop, and batter life doesn’t matter in this case. Any way TLP is installed by default. Now, what needs to be done? Go to: /etc/tlp.conf and add the line there:\nWOL_DISABLE=N"

    "text": "Guernica by Pablo Picasso\nI always make lough that Pablo knew sth more about coming digital IT revolution hence he invented the Cubism. Here in Guernica from 1937, Cubism sought to depict subjects from multiple viewpoints simultaneously, breaking them down into geometric shapes and fragments. While “Guernica” does bear elements of Cubism, it also incorporates elements of Surrealism due to its dreamlike and symbolic imagery.\nAnyway, the painting pictures the Spanish Civil War from the beginning of the 20th-century, which I didn’t know after I saw this picture for the first time. But right away this piece of art spoke to me as a metaphor for nowadays. Electricity was entering Europe this time, so the lightbulb was on the canvas - the light of progress. Today with the .ai hype is similar ;). Although in many places we live in peace, everybody fights their own battle with surrounding circumstances, weaknesses, and so on.\nJust for fun I put the Guernica on Linkedin header. This raised my question, Is this legal? As it turns out linkedIN, checked the copyright under the hood and the header was not disabled. But for double check, I asked the chat GPT. Here is the answer: As of my last update in January 2022, “Guernica” by Pablo Picasso is in the public domain, which means it is not subject to copyright restrictions. Therefore, you can typically display it on a private website without legal issues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\nmore on Guernica"
