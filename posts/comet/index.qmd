The phenomenon of passing comet in the CET time zone in the southwestern part of my sky lasted for several Earth days. However, I wanted to record somehow characteristic tail for the comet. Stellarium app helped to locate the position of the C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan-ATLAS) comet. The challenge was to take a photo because, in my time zone, it was already a very dark night. With help came the cell phone.
