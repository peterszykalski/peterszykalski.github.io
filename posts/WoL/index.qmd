### WoL in short
For short Wake-on-LAN (WoL) is a feature in which a PHY network card in a very low power state can be awakened by a host using a uniquely formatted packet called a magic packet. This requires decoding a magic packet and alerting a board controller by asserting an interrupt pin when a packet match is detected - this will start your computer.
How this happens? 
Install wakeonlan tool and then execute the command. This command sends famous "magic packet". 
`sudo wakeonlan [$mac_address of computer you want to wakeUP]`
`Sending magic packet to 255.255.255.255:9 with [$mac_address]`
